# Security Policy

This document outlines our security policy for the codebase and product, and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a vulnerability or security-related issue, _please report them to us directly_.

**Do not create GitHub issues for security issues.** Instead, please send an email to `_TBD_` or ask us to reach out to you and we'll look into it immediately.

We appreciate any responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities that might impact the integrity of our platforms, users, and/or partners.
