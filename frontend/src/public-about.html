  ReportStream (also known as PRIME ReportStream) was created by the CDC and the <a href="{{ site.orgs.USDS.url }}" class="usa-link">U.S. Digital Service (USDS)</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/projects/pandemic-ready-it-systems.html" class="usa-link">Pandemic-Ready Interoperability Modernization Effort (PRIME)</a>. PRIME is a multi-year collaboration to strengthen data quality and information technology systems in state and local health departments.

  The U.S. Digital Service is a group of technologists from diverse backgrounds working across the federal government to transform critical services for the people. Specialists join for tours of civic service to create a steady influx of fresh perspectives.
