  ## ReportStream is an open source, cloud based  platform that aggregates and delivers COVID-19 test results to health departments. We send data directly from testing facilities, labs, and more through a single connection, helping to streamline public health reporting.

  ReportStream (also known as PRIME ReportStream) was created by the CDC and the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) as part of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/projects/pandemic-ready-it-systems.html" class="usa-link">Pandemic-Ready Interoperability Modernization Effort (PRIME)</a>. PRIME is a multi-year collaboration to strengthen data quality and information technology systems in state and local health departments.
