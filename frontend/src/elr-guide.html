  <h1 class="margin-y-0">Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) integration guide</h1>
  <p class="usa-intro margin-top-0">Public health departments can build a direct connection with ReportStream to receive complete, well-structured COVID-19 ELR data. </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Benefits of building a direct connection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Receive data from SimpleReport</strong><br />
      If your jurisdiction is interested in receiving point-of-care tests results from  <a href="">SimpleReport</a>, you can access this data from the ReportStream connection.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Support fewer connections</strong><br />
      ReportStream’s model focuses on aggregating data from multiple sources and senders, which you receive together in a single feed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Get complete, timely data</strong><br />
      ReportStream validates data from its senders, and transfers it to you at your preferred frequency and format.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Integration overview</h2>
  <p>Connecting with the ReportStream platform is very similar to setting up an ELR feed with a lab or hospital. Here is a sample timeline for an integration.</p>
  <p>TABLE HERE</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Integration details</h2>
  <p>The ReportStream team offers a standard set of configurations that enables a short turnaround time from kickoff to integration.</p>
  <h3>Data schema</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>ReportStream’s value set follows the HHS guidance for COVID-19 Lab Data Reporting, including the COVID-19 “Ask On Entry” questions</li>
    <li>Our standard way of submitting this data is via HL7 version 2.5.1</li>
    <li>Sending the “Ask On Entry” questions are optional, and are sent via OBX fields</li>
    <li>Other file formats such as CSV can be supported but may lead to a delay in integration</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Data transport</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>ReportStream support SFTP connections as our standard connection type</li>
    <li>Data can be sent real-time or batched in daily increments</li>
    <li>Additional transport platforms such as VPN, PNIMS, SOAP, etc., can be supported but may lead to a delay in integration</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Site registration process</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>ReportStream works as an aggregator and submits data on behalf of multiple senders and organizations collecting COVID-19 data (eg. long-term care facilities, schools, etc.)</li>
    <li>ReportStream collects unique identifiers from each sender as they are registered to send, such as Organization/Site Name, CLIA, and Address. The sending facility information is generally included in the daily feed already.</li>
    <li>To track new facilities and senders, ReportStream can optionally send a spreadsheet on a weekly cadence to an email address of your choice whenever there are new facilities.</li>
    <li>Any custom requirements around site registration may lead to be a delay in integration.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Sample File Testing and Launch Process</h3>
  <p>ReportStream can support sending a variety of data types for testing before launch.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Testing – Synthetic Data
        <ul>
          <li>ReportStream will always send one or more rounds of synthetic data in the standard data schema for your review
</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Testing – Patient Data
        <ul>
          <li>If required, ReportStream can also send patient data to your test servers</li>
          <li>In certain cases, ReportStream will not have a live senders in your jurisdiction. In this case, we can wait for a live facility to move to production sign off</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Production Signoff/Launch
        <ul>
          <li>For the first facility, we can send patient data to your testing server before moving onto production</li>
          <li>For subsequent organizations/facilities, we will send data directly to production </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Local Jurisdictions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>ReportStream has the ability to send data to state, county, city, territorial, and tribal public health departments</li>
    <li>Once a state has been onboarded, then by default we send data to the state if 1) the patient is a resident or 2) the facility is present in the state</li>
    <li>We also optionally make the data available to a local public health department based on these rules</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Who owns the data?</strong><br />
    The ordering facilities own their own data. We submit on their behalf. We have a policy of transitory data retention.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Where does the data live?</strong><br />
  The data is currently encrypted and routed through a CDC Cloud environment, where it is deleted after 14 days.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Can the ReportStream interface with senders other than SimpleReport? </strong><br />
  Yes. We are currently prioritizing large, multi-state senders, but if you have other senders you’d like to re-direct to ReportStream, please get in contact with us regarding interfacing with additional senders.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Do you currently send data to NHSN?</strong><br />
    Not currently.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Do you send data to APHL?</strong><br />
    Not currently.
