  ## First, we’ll get you connected to our web application, where you can start downloading reporting data immediately from all over your jurisdiction.  Depending on your needs, we can also create a customized Electronic Lab Reporting (ELR) connection —  an online setup used to send digital lab reports to public health departments via a secure server. Either way, reach out to us and we’ll get back to you in about a week.
