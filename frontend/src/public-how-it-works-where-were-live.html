  ReportStream has established connections to send and report public health data for each of the states and territories listed here. 

{% if content.where-were-live %}
<ul>
{% for partner in content.where-were-live.partners %}
<li>{{ partner.name }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endif %}

Companies or testing facilities sending test results may still need to register directly with the state before sending data to their public health department.
