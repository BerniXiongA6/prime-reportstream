## Background

As the number of connections the Hub makes increases, the management of tech support will quickly become burdensome. Support is currently ad-hoc and has no documented process.

## Goals

Establish a process for tech support.

## Proposal

### What we will do:

#### Email support with ticketing system (Airtable to start)

- Partners will contact us via email at `support@prime.cdc.gov`.
- Team will determine a monitoring schedule to be shared across members. Cadence TBD.
- Support inbox will be monitored during normal sending hours on days when data is being sent.
  - Sending hours are times we're scheduled to send data to partners, TBD based on partners.
  - Changes to support hours will be communicated to partners via email with as much advance notice as possible.
- Monitoring team will translate support emails into tickets on a kanban board using an issue template.
  - Tickets will have a team member assigned. If unclear who to assign, flag the team in chat.
  - For tickets with high impact, monitoring team will also personally reach out to assigned team member as well.
- As the issue is worked on and resolved, assigned team member will keep partner updated on status.

### What we won't do:

- Provide phone support
